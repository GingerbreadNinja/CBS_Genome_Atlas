Coding work to do to complete Milestone 2

- add environment and abundance, doubling time, growth temp, number genes

- look at rnammer updates

- perc AT is stored as int -- needs more precision?
- db should store whether the gbk file is on disk
- db should store the errors from each step

- accession, version in db should have the pair be the reference to replicon table
- database table jobstep should include the version of the program (trnascan, rnammer hmmer, etc) that is being run
- write tests for Makefile
- write tests for log insertion script
- db updates moved to main db module
- we won't have the new genomes processed until the next day because it is looking at the modify date, not datetime; is this a problem?

- validation heuristics
- mark genomes as valid if pass heuristics

- scope reporting system
- scope mechanism to grant/deny manual approval for genomes


Statistics to calculate

- number of replicons
- combined length
- percent AT
+ trna
- rrna
- codon usage


Problems with genomes
send dave accession numbers with errors


vibrio -- CP000626 and CP000627 are flipped

BX571656_1.gbk is marked as complete, but does not have a sequence

FP929051_1.trna not parsing correctly -- AA: Sup -- added to database
