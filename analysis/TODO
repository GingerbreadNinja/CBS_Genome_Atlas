+ trnascan-stats needs to be written

jobsteps should update database with errors when they error out!

check everywhere that accession really is just the accession number and does not contain the version also

accession, version in db should have the pair be the reference to replicon table

database table jobstep should include the version of the program (trnascan, rnammer hmmer, etc) that is being run

write tests for log insertion script

db updates moved to main db module

we won't have the new genomes processed until the next day because it is looking at the modify date, not datetime
