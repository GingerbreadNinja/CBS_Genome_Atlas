Coding work to do to complete Milestone 2

- jobsteps should update database with errors when they error out!
- accession, version in db should have the pair be the reference to replicon table
- database table jobstep should include the version of the program (trnascan, rnammer hmmer, etc) that is being run
- write tests for Makefile
- write tests for log insertion script
- null accession numbers are being written into trna table
- db updates moved to main db module
- we won't have the new genomes processed until the next day because it is looking at the modify date, not datetime; is this a problem?
- calculate sequence length
- rnammer running with hmmer 3
- validation heuristics
- mark genomes as valid if pass heuristics
- scope reporting system
- scope mechanism to grant/deny manual approval for genomes
- add other statistic calculations
- go through output and make sure it is descriptive, useful, properly split between .err and .out
- job is not removed from db -- mark entire job as in error


Statistics to calculate

- number of replicons
- combined length
- percent AT
+ trna
- rrna
- codon usage


Problems with genomes

BX571656_1.gbk is marked as complete, but does not have a sequence

FP929051_1.trna not parsing correctly -- AA: Sup?
