Coding work to do to complete Milestone 2

- store length of replicon in replicon table
- calculate percent at and store in replicon table
- view for number of replicons and total genome length, percent at

- run for all in test accession file
- run rrnas for all in test accession file

- look at rnammer updates

- accession, version in db should have the pair be the reference to replicon table
- database table jobstep should include the version of the program (trnascan, rnammer hmmer, etc) that is being run
- write tests for Makefile
- write tests for log insertion script
- db updates moved to main db module
- we won't have the new genomes processed until the next day because it is looking at the modify date, not datetime; is this a problem?

- validation heuristics
- mark genomes as valid if pass heuristics

- scope reporting system
- scope mechanism to grant/deny manual approval for genomes


Statistics to calculate

- number of replicons
- combined length
- percent AT
+ trna
- rrna
- codon usage


Problems with genomes

BX571656_1.gbk is marked as complete, but does not have a sequence

FP929051_1.trna not parsing correctly -- AA: Sup?
