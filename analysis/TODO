accession number needs to have version stripped in all code

database table jobstep should include the version of the program (trnascan, rnammer hmmer, etc) that is being run

write tests for Makefile
write tests for log insertion script

db updates moved to main db scripts

trnascan-stats needs to be written


using full version of accession number everywhere, but it does not have the dot.  is this a problem?


we won't have the new genomes processed until the next day because it is looking at the modify date, not datetime
